🎥 5-Minute Pitch Script
TraceHarvest – Transparent Campus Food Supply Chain using Blockchain
⏱️ 0:00 – 0:40 | Hook & Problem
“Every day, thousands of students in our college eat food from the hostel or canteen without knowing where it comes from.
We don’t know:
Which farmer grew the vegetables
Whether the produce is organic or chemically treated
Whether vendors are changing or manipulating records
Currently, all this information is maintained in centralized systems or on paper, which can be easily modified or hidden.
This lack of transparency leads to mistrust, food quality complaints, and zero accountability.”
⏱️ 0:40 – 1:30 | Campus-Level Relevance
“This is a real campus problem.
Our college hostel and canteen source food from multiple vendors and local farms. Students have no way to verify the origin or journey of the food they consume every day.
At the same time, farmers supplying good-quality produce do not get recognition or trust because their data is not verifiable.
So the question is: How do we bring trust, transparency, and accountability into our campus food supply chain?”
⏱️ 1:30 – 2:30 | Solution Overview
“We built AgriTrace, a blockchain-based food supply chain transparency system designed specifically for college campuses.
AgriTrace tracks food items from: Farmer → Distributor → Campus Vendor → Hostel/Canteen
Each step is recorded on the blockchain as a tamper-proof transaction.
Students can simply scan a QR code on the food batch and instantly see:
Who produced it
When it was harvested
Who transported it
When it reached the campus
All data is publicly verifiable and cannot be altered.”
⏱️ 2:30 – 3:30 | Why Web3? (Most Important Part)
“A traditional Web2 solution is not enough for this problem.
In Web2:
Data is stored in a centralized database
Vendors or admins can modify records
Students must blindly trust the system
In Web3:
Records are stored on an immutable blockchain
No single authority can change the data
Trust is enforced by smart contracts, not people
Blockchain ensures:
Immutability – records cannot be tampered with
Transparency – anyone can verify data
Decentralization – no single point of control
This level of trust cannot be achieved using Web2 systems, which is why Web3 is essential for AgriTrace.”
⏱️ 3:30 – 4:20 | Technical Architecture & MVP
“From a technical perspective:
Smart contracts are written in Solidity
We use a testnet blockchain like Polygon or Ethereum Sepolia
IPFS is used to store certificates like organic proofs
The frontend is built using React and ethers.js
Wallet authentication is done using MetaMask
For our MVP:
Farmers register a crop batch
Vendors update delivery status
Canteen confirms receipt
Students scan a QR code to view the complete supply chain history”
⏱️ 4:20 – 4:50 | Impact & Feasibility
“AgriTrace brings:
Transparency for students
Accountability for vendors
Fair recognition for farmers
Trust in campus food systems
This solution is practical, deployable, and can be implemented within a college ecosystem without disrupting existing processes.”
⏱️ 4:50 – 5:00 | Closing
“AgriTrace is not just a blockchain project.
It’s a trust layer for what we eat every day.
By using Web3, we turn food transparency from a promise into a guarantee.
Thank you.”

🎥 Short Pitch Script
TraceHarvest – Transparent Campus Food Supply Chain using Blockchain
“Every day, students eat hostel and canteen food without knowing where it comes from.
We don’t know which farmer grew it, how it was handled, or whether records were altered.
Today, this data is stored on paper or centralized systems, which can be changed easily—leading to mistrust and no accountability.”

“This is a real campus problem.
Our college sources food from multiple vendors and farms, but students cannot verify its origin, and honest farmers get no recognition.”

“To solve this, we built TraceHarvest, a blockchain-based food supply chain system for college campuses.
It tracks food from farmer to canteen, recording every step on the blockchain.
Students scan a QR code to instantly see who produced the food, when it was harvested, and how it reached the campus.”

“Web2 is not enough because data can be modified by a central authority.
TraceHarvest uses Web3 to ensure immutability, transparency, and decentralization, where trust is enforced by smart contracts—not people.”

“Our MVP uses Solidity smart contracts, a testnet blockchain, IPFS for certificates, and a React-based frontend.
It is practical, deployable, and fits perfectly within a college ecosystem.”

“TraceHarvest is not just a blockchain project—it’s a trust layer for campus food systems.
Thank you.”

🥬 TraceHarvest
Transparent Campus Food Supply Chain using Blockchain
📌 Problem Statement
In college hostels and canteens, students consume food daily without knowing:

Who grew the produce

How it was handled or transported

Whether records were altered

Currently, food supply data is stored in centralized systems or on paper, which can be modified or hidden. This lack of transparency results in mistrust, food quality complaints, and zero accountability.

💡 Solution Overview
TraceHarvest is a blockchain-based food supply chain transparency system designed specifically for college campuses.

It tracks food items across the entire journey:
Farmer → Distributor → Campus Vendor → Hostel/Canteen

Each stage is recorded as a tamper-proof blockchain transaction.
Students can scan a QR code on a food batch to instantly view its complete history.

🔗 Why Web3?
Traditional Web2 systems are insufficient because:

Data is centrally stored

Records can be altered by admins or vendors

Users must blindly trust the system

TraceHarvest uses Web3 to ensure:

Immutability – records cannot be tampered with

Transparency – anyone can verify the data

Decentralization – no single authority controls the system

Trust is enforced through smart contracts, not people.

🛠️ Technical Architecture
Smart Contracts: Solidity

Blockchain: Ethereum Sepolia / Polygon Testnet

Storage: IPFS (for certificates like organic proofs)

Frontend: React + ethers.js

Wallet Authentication: MetaMask

QR Codes: For batch-level traceability

🚀 MVP Workflow
Farmer registers a crop batch on the blockchain

Vendor updates delivery and transport status

Canteen confirms receipt

Students scan a QR code to view the full supply chain history

🌱 Impact
Transparency for students

Accountability for vendors

Fair recognition for farmers

Increased trust in campus food systems

✅ Feasibility
TraceHarvest is:

Practical and deployable

Easy to integrate into existing campus workflows

Scalable to multiple campuses and institutions

🏁 Conclusion
TraceHarvest is not just a blockchain project.
It is a trust layer for what we eat every day, turning food transparency from a promise into a guarantee.
