🥬 TraceHarvest

(Transparent Campus Food Supply Chain using Blockchain)

📌 Problem Statement:

In college hostels and canteens, students consume food daily without knowing:

Who grew the produce

How it was handled or transported

Whether records were altered

Currently, food supply data is stored in centralized systems or on paper, which can be modified or hidden. This lack of transparency results in mistrust, food quality complaints, and zero accountability.

💡 Solution Overview:

TraceHarvest is a blockchain-based food supply chain transparency system designed specifically for college campuses.

It tracks food items across the entire journey:

Farmer → Distributor → Campus Vendor → Hostel/Canteen

Each stage is recorded as a tamper-proof blockchain transaction.

Students can scan a QR code on a food batch to instantly view its complete history.

🔗 Why Web3?

Traditional Web2 systems are insufficient because:

Data is centrally stored

Records can be altered by admins or vendors

Users must blindly trust the system

TraceHarvest uses Web3 to ensure:

Immutability – records cannot be tampered with

Transparency – anyone can verify the data

Decentralization – no single authority controls the system

Trust is enforced through smart contracts, not people.

🛠️ Technical Architecture:

Smart Contracts: Solidity

Blockchain: Ethereum Sepolia / Polygon Testnet

Storage: IPFS (for certificates like organic proofs)

Frontend: React + ethers.js

Wallet Authentication: MetaMask

QR Codes: For batch-level traceability

🚀 MVP Workflow:

Farmer registers a crop batch on the blockchain

Vendor updates delivery and transport status

Canteen confirms receipt

Students scan a QR code to view the full supply chain history

🌱 Impact:

Transparency for students

Accountability for vendors

Fair recognition for farmers

Increased trust in campus food systems

✅ Feasibility:

TraceHarvest is:

Practical and deployable

Easy to integrate into existing campus workflows

Scalable to multiple campuses and institutions

🏁 Conclusion:

TraceHarvest is not just a blockchain project.

It is a trust layer for what we eat every day, turning food transparency from a promise into a guarantee.
